# MuchWow

We heard the call for an outdated meme app. Here comes our best effort.

## Getting Started

Simply type ` npm install muchwowapp ` into your terminal of choice to download the app and latest dependencies.

After that, run the app with ` npm start muchwowapp ` and run over to localhost:8080 to checkout the results. Refresh continuously and laugh over and over at how meme we are.

### Prerequisites

A little bit of terminal know-how. If you don't have that, check the app out at http://LMulvey.github.io/MuchWow [soon] for a web, user-friendly experience.
